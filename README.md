# Openwing
Simple, barebones, no-bs website made to make it easier to find hidden gems and underrated games in Roblox.

### Adding new games
1. First, make sure that the game hasn't been already added to the list. If it hasn't, great. If you are the developer of the game you are trying to submit, please keep in mind that you must clarify that you are the developer or part of the dev team, and you cannot add a description, I will play the game and add one.
2. Now, after you have confirmed all of those requirements: Fill all of these for the game you are going to submit, following the comments then deleting them:
```js
{
      "id": "example", // One word only, remove spaces.
      "name": "Example", // Full name of the game. Do not include words like [BETA], [UPDATE], [NEW], etc.
      "link": "https://www.roblox.com/games/123/example", // Copy and paste the link.
      "creator": "example", // If the game is indie, the username of the developer. If the game is made by a group, its name.
      "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin ut ornare velit, ac lobortis nulla. Suspendisse eu nulla viverra, maximus arcu in, porta neque. Donec eget vestibulum libero. Integer fringilla faucibus ultrices. Ut et lectus rhoncus, pharetra neque id, tincidunt tortor. Cras massa dui, tempus non urna vel, lobortis gravida massa.", // One paragraph - describe from your perspective the game, base it off already existing descriptions in 'games.json'. You can be subjective.
      "submitted_by": "your name", // Self-explanatory.
      "icon": "link", // Link to the icon image of the game. Must be a 'tr.rbxcdn.com', if in doubt, check the other already existing links.
      "banner": "link", // Same as above but with the main banner of an applicable one.
      "genres": ["Example", "Example", "Example"], // Three to eight genres that fit the game. Please check the 'genres' section.
      "age": "example", // 9+, 10+, 11+, 12+, 13+, etc. Please rate it based on your experience in the game, not necessarily by the official rating. For example, if the game is too complex for someone under the age of X to understand, or its community is too toxic, it should be X+.
      "R6": true, // True or \false values; Select one of them if the game is only that rig type, the two if the game is 'User Choice' and none if the game doesn't use neither.
      "R15": false, // Same as above.
      "vc": false // True if the game supports voice chat, false if it doesn't.
    }
```
3. After having saved the edited text somewhere, fork this repository, go to 'games.json', and add comma exactly where the pointer is, then paste the text you just saved.

4. Now create a .html file in the 'game/' directory, named exactly what you put in the 'id', then copy and paste this code and put it in, **do not change anything**.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Loading...</title>
  <script src="../scripts/script.js"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/style.css">
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

After you have done that, it should look something like this. Do not forget to put the .html at the end:

5. Finally, just open a pull request based on your fork and I will soon review it, play the game, and add your submission. Thank you for contributing to Openwing!

### Genres

To better organize games and make it easier to find them, all the games in Openwing have multiple genres, some obligatory and some made by the submitter. Here is a list of the genres you must put, that are not optional. First, the size-based ones:

- "**Massive**" - applied to games that usually recieve over 1k players. Very rare.

- "**Big**" - applied to games that recieve usual player counts above 100 and less than 1k, and that actively recieve updates.

- "**Medium**" - applied to games that recieve player counts from 100-30, and/or that are actively updated by their developers when needed.

- "**Small**" - applied to games that recieve usual player counts from 30-10, and/or that are mildly updated once in a while by its developers.

- "**Moribund**" - applied to games that rarely but sometimes recieve players, but in very small quantities (basically up to 10 or so), and that the developers have mostly abandoned it.

- "**Abandoned**" - applied to games that recieve no players for a long time, are forgotten to time, and/or its developers have abandoned it.

Also, there is the "Indie" genre, that must be always inserted when the game is made by one single developer, with very few to no contributions from others. Then, there are the pre-existing genres. These ones should be applied to games that fill specific requirements. Other than these, you can create your own genres as you see fit, or suggest a new one.

- "**Shooting**" - any game that involves shooting as its one of its main goals

- "**FPS**" - shooting games that are exclusively or mostly in first person

- "**Realistic**" - games that have mechanics very similar to IRL and have put a high emphasis on that (a bit subjective)

- "**Horror**" - horror games, no clarification needed

- "**Singleplayer**" - when the game isn't multiplayer (no "Multiplayer" genre is necessary when the game isn't singleplayer)

- "**Open world**" - games that have a map where you can freely walk, independent of tasks, quests, or limitations (no matter the size of the map)

- "**Medieval**" - games inspired or that take place in the middle ages in Europe (for other continents... well idk really)

- "**Philosophical**" - any game that makes you think about and question life, or that feature such scenarios

- "**Western**" - games that take place or are inspired in the Western Frontier of the USA anywhere in the 1850sâ€“1910s (or somewhere close to there) or that depict Manifest Destiny

- "**Showcase**" - games that are made to showcase a place or a building, generally made by very experienced builders of a team of them, and mostly they don't contain much gameplay

- "**Spiritual**" - any game that has a religious or esoteric value to it that you personally think that transcends Roblox, be it intentionally or unintentionally (is a reserved and rare genre)

- "**Multiple endings**" - games that have various different story endings to them, and they may or may not have as one of the main goals of it to collect them all

- "**Battlegrounds**" - any game where you are thrown in a map or an arena and is expected to fight other players (or bots, but must also include players) to death, all at once

- "**Melee**" - games opposing to shooting games, where its main mechanic includes melee weapons, contrasting with gun or bow games for example (shooting games that also have melee fighting options are not included)

- "**Social experiment**" - games that are made to test mental experiment on players in order to see how they react to something (if in doubt, check the other submissions with the social experiment genre)
